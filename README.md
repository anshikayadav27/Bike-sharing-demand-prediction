**Project Summary**

The "Bike Seoul" initiative in South Korea represents a forward-thinking approach to sustainable urban transportation, offering residents and visitors access to bike sharing services. With the goal of reducing traffic congestion and promoting eco-friendly mobility, the initiative has become integral to the city's transportation landscape. However, as the demand for bike rentals continues to rise, efficient management of bike sharing operations becomes paramount.

Our project focused on developing a machine learning model to accurately predict bike rental demand in Seoul. Leveraging historical data and relevant factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and public holidays, we employed regression analysis techniques to model bike demand patterns. The dataset, sourced from the Seoul city government's open data portal and Kaggle, provided the foundation for our analysis.

Our primary objective was to achieve a prediction accuracy of at least 85%, enabling bike sharing service providers to optimize fleet management and respond to demand fluctuations in real-time. To achieve this, we explored various regression algorithms, including linear regression, random forest, decision tree, and gradient boosting. Through rigorous hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, we ultimately selected the XGBoost algorithm for its outstanding performance, achieving approximately 99% accuracy on the training data and 95% on the test data.

By providing insights into bike demand patterns and demonstrating the practical applications of machine learning in transportation management, our project offers a roadmap for enhancing bike sharing services not only in Seoul but also in other cities with similar initiatives. With its potential to optimize operations, reduce waste, and improve sustainability, our work contributes to the ongoing evolution of urban transportation systems worldwide.

**Problem Statement**

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.
